# Cardano Learning Journey 

Welcome! This repository documents my progress in learning to develop on the Cardano blockchain.  
Over the next six weeks, I’ll be studying **Plutus**, **Aiken**, **Haskell**, and **Marlowe**, building small projects that show my understanding.

###  Learning Roadmap
- Week 1: Setup and Cardano fundamentals
- Week 2: Haskell basics and Plutus introduction
- Week 3: Writing simple contracts in Aiken
- Week 4: Exploring Marlowe for financial contracts
- Week 5: Wallet interaction and off-chain logic
- Week 6: Final project – publish a working smart contract

###  Goals
- Understand Cardano’s EUTXO model  
- Build and deploy small test contracts  
- Maintain active commits on GitHub  
- Demonstrate skills relevant to Project Catalyst technical roles
