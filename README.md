# Cardano Learning Journey  
**By Benjamin Alagyira**

Welcome to my Cardano developer learning journey!  
This repository documents my hands-on exploration into **Cardano blockchain development** — learning and building with **Plutus**, **Aiken**, **Haskell**, and **Marlowe**.  


## Objective  
To build a strong understanding of Cardano’s development environment and gain hands-on experience with some development languages


##  Goals
- Understand how smart contracts work
- Understand Cardano’s EUTXO model  
- Build and deploy small test contracts  
- Maintain active commits on GitHub  

  
## Tools & Languages
- **Plutus / Haskell** – Core Cardano smart contract logic  
- **Aiken** – Lightweight language for writing and testing smart contracts  
- **Marlowe** – No-code/low-code contracts for financial use cases  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and public documentation  
- **Node.js (optional)** – Off-chain and wallet interaction  


  ## Learning Roadmap
- Milestone 1: Setup and Cardano fundamentals
- Milestone 2: Haskell basics and Plutus introduction
- Milestone 3: Writing simple contracts in Aiken
- Milestone 4: Exploring Marlowe for financial contracts
- Milestone 5: Wallet interaction and off-chain logic
- Milestone 6: Final project – publish a working smart contract
